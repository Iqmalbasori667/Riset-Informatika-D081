Abstract:

Consumers who have shopped at E-Commerce will provide 
reviews/comments on products that have been purchased. Customer 
confidence in the rating is hampered due to inconsistency of answers 
such as reviews that have negative text with a positive rating value. For 
this reason, a technique is needed to adjust the rating with comments or 
reviews of purchased goods to make it easier for consumers when 
shopping to see the rating directly without reading the 
reviews/comments of previous buyers. purpose of this study is to classify 
comments and ratings and then obtain the results of the accuracy of the 
classification system so that the above problems can be answered.This 
study uses Support Vector Machine classification technique because this 
algorithm is better in classificationâ€™s terms. Data used are 1044 comment 
data and 1044 rating. Data are grouped into Good, Neutral, Less good 
categories using Python by Google Colab and divided into training and 
test data. To test capability of system, data that has been classified then 
analyzed using Confusion matrix. Results showed that SVM Algorithm 
was able to classify with an accuracy rate of 71.14%, 88% precision, and 
79% recall.SVM algorithm is able to formulate training data with an 
accuracy of 91.3%.
