Abstract:

Forecasting solar power production accurately is critical for effectively planning and managing renewable energy systems.
This paper introduces and investigates novel hybrid deep learning models for solar power forecasting using time series
data. The research analyzes the efficacy of various models for capturing the complex patterns present in solar power data.
In this study, all of the possible combinations of convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM),
and transformer (TF) models are experimented. These hybrid models also compared with the single CNN, LSTM and TF
models with respect to different kinds of optimizers. Three different evaluation metrics are also employed for performance
analysis. Results show that the CNN–LSTM–TF hybrid model outperforms the other models, with a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 0.551% when using the Nadam optimizer. However, the TF–LSTM model has relatively low performance, with
an MAE of 16.17%, highlighting the difficulties in making reliable predictions of solar power. This result provides valuable
insights for optimizing and planning renewable energy systems, highlighting the significance of selecting appropriate
models and optimizers for accurate solar power forecasting. This is the first time such a comprehensive work presented that
also involves transformer networks in hybrid models for solar power forecasting.
